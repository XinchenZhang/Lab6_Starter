They were barely tender. They tasted almost like tacos rather than BBQ. The sauce was much thinner than pictured. It barely coated the ribs and we eventually just added our bottled sauce on the plate for dipping. If I were to use this recipe again I would cut the chili powder by at least half, add 1 to 2 hours to the cook time and decrease the amount of the juice that gets reduced and mixed with the BBQ sauce.","datePublished":"2021-10-11"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anonymous"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5"},"reviewBody":"They are the best ribs ever.
